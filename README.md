# Multi-Layer-Perceptron

Classify a given dataset with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (implemented by sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier), than determine whether applying PCA to this dataset is useful, and if so what number of components you would choose to use. At the end of the analysis, chose an optimal strategy, including the optimal set of parameters for the classifier.
